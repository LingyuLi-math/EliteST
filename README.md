# EliteST or Elite4ST
an vit-structurEd muLtI-channel foundaTion modEl for Spatial Transcriptomics
The increasing availability of large-scale spatial transcriptomic (ST) and imaging datasets, coupled with their continued expansion, suggests the imminent development of ST-based foundation models. Potential applications include enhanced cellular segmentation, cell-type annotation, and imputation, among others.
